# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

**Project Context**: Always read `@/openspec/project.md` first to understand:
- Project purpose and tech stack
- Domain concepts and core entities
- Development constraints and conventions
- Testing requirements (TDD mandatory)
- Git workflow and code standards

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
